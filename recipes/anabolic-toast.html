    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Meat, protein powder, fish, eggs can get quite expensive in certain countries. But what is pretty cheap for most of us is bread and certain dairy products, including twarog, skyr, greek yoghurt and, sometimes, cottage cheese. So it is a good option to combine such products together to create a tasty and ANABOLIC meal.
