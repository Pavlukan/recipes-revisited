A revisited version of the Recipes project

## Description
Due to certain reasons, I had to stop coding for an entire year. You can observe that in my GitHub heatmap history. 

Naturally I have forgotten many concepts related to HTML and CSS. For example, Flexbox, relative units, CSS variables, Grid layout, etc. Instead of rediscovering them again in a structured and rigid manner, I decided to use Recipes project as the training ground.

Spoiler alert: it was amazing. Not only did I discover that my knowledge was still there, but the act of researching itself was highly rewarding. 

I hope this feeling of curiosity stays with me for the whole length of The Odin Project.
